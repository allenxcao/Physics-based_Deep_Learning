# Physics-based_Deep_Learning

Advantages of Deep Learning:

1. Fast computations once trained
2. Capable of handling nonlinear functions effectively

   
Disadvantages of Deep Learning:

1. Requires large datasets for effective training
2. Challenging to optimize due to potential local minima
3. Difficult to interpret results

   
When to Apply Deep Learning:

1. Use deep learning to approximate parts where classical methods perform poorly.
2. Accelerate simulation processes.
